A Blast filter is used as a container of a filtered result and a Blast reader, along with cumulative status.

It contains utility methods for easy querying of Blast filtered results. For example the #alignsFullIdentity select hits with full alignments, (i.e. Identities is 100%) this is, if Hsp_positive = 326 and Hsp_align-len = 327 identity is 99%.
