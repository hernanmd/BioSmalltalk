# Description

BioSmalltalk is an Open-Source (MIT-licensed) library for Bioinformatics using Smalltalk (currently [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org)).

# Installation

There are several ways to install the **BioSmalltalk**. At minimum, you need a working Pharo virtual image installed in your system. Check the [Pharo website](http://www.pharo.org) for installation information regarding the Pharo Open-Source system. Once Pharo is launched you have the following installation options:


**Group**|**BioTools**|**BioParsers**|**BioWrappers**|**BioFormatters**|**BioClassifier**|**BioNCBI**|**BioBlast**|**BioEntrez**
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
All|-|-|-| -| -| -| -|-|
Basic|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
Core|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
Tests|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

To evaluate the following scripts, open a "Playground" window by clicking an empty area in the Pharo window and select Tools -> Playground. To actually evaluate the pasted script, click on the upper right green arrow or highlight the script code and right click for options.

    onWarningLog;
    load ]
on: IceGenericError 
do: [ : ex | ex retry ]
```

## Baseline String

If you want to add BioSmalltalk to your Metacello Baselines or Configurations, copy and paste the following expression:

        " ... "
        spec
                baseline: 'BioSmalltalk' 
                with: [ spec repository: 'github://hernanmd/BioSmalltalk/repository' ];
        " ... "

If you want to add a BioSmalltalk installation group to your Metacello Baselines or Configurations, copy and paste the following expression, replacing Basic with the group of your interest:

        " ... "
        spec
                baseline: 'BioSmalltalk' 
                with: [ spec load: #('Basic'); repository: 'github://hernanmd/BioSmalltalk/repository' ];
        " ... "
