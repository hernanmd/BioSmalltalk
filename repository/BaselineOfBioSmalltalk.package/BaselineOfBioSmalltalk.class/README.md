BioSmalltalk is an open source library for doing bioinformatics with Smalltalk. BioSmalltalk enables you to build bioinformatics scripts and applications using the most powerful object technology as of today, the Smalltalk programming environment.


BioSmalltalk contains:
	
- Basic biological objects, like BioSequence, BioSeqRecord, BioAlignment, BioFastaRecord, BioCodonTable, etc
- BLAST objects for querying and filtering results from NCBI or locally. Tests and examples are included.
- Entrez system API with tests and examples
- Writers for formatted files as CSV, FASTA, HaploView, Fluxus Network, etc.
- Parsers for reading formatted files like XML, FASTA, NCBI identifiers or DNA sequences with degenerate bases as sent from Illumina reports, i.e. of the form : ''A[A/C]CTG'' or ''AT[A/C]TA[C/A]''.
- Tools, for creating custom views of objects using inspectors, explorers or browsers.
