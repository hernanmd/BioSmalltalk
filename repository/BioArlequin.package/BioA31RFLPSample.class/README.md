Arlequin can handle RFLP haplotypes of arbitrary length. Each restriction site is considered as a distinct locus. The presence of a restriction site should be coded as a '1', and its absence as a '0'. The '-' character should be used to denote the deletion of a site, not its absence due to a point mutation
