GTBlast is your main interface class for accessing to the BLAST program. You may perform BLAST in several ways, for example accessing through NCBI blast but in the local machine, or in a remote NCBI server, or a local blast but using the Washington University version (WU-BLAST).

Running the local versions require you have installed previously the BLAST client on your machine.
