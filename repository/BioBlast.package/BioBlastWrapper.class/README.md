Main interface class for accessing to the BLAST software from BioSmalltalk. 

You may execute BLAST in several ways, for example :

- The NCBI BLAST running in the local machine, 
- In a remote NCBI server, 
- A local blast but using the Washington University version (WU-BLAST).

Running the local versions require you have installed previously the BLAST client on your machine.
