From the MEGA website: "MEGA is an integrated tool for conducting sequence alignment, inferring phylogenetic trees, estimating divergence times, mining online databases, estimating rates of molecular evolution, inferring ancestral sequences, and testing evolutionary hypotheses.".

This class is an exporter for the MEGA file format.

MEGA Input Format may contain

-DNA sequence, 
-Protein sequence, 
-Evolutionary distance, 
-Phylogenetic tree data

 data formats for molecular sequences, distances, and phylogenetic trees separately. However, there are a number of features that are common to all MEGA data files.
