From the MEGA website: "MEGA is an integrated tool for conducting sequence alignment, inferring phylogenetic trees, estimating divergence times, mining online databases, estimating rates of molecular evolution, inferring ancestral sequences, and testing evolutionary hypotheses.".

This class is an exporter for the MEGA file format.

 data formats for molecular sequences, distances, and phylogenetic trees separately. However, there are a number of features that are common to all MEGA data files.

DNA sequence, 
protein sequence, 
evolutionary distance, 
phylogenetic tree data
