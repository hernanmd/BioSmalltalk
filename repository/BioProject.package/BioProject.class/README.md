GTProject is the main interface object to work in a controlled/organized way. Using a project you will be able to track your actions whithin a work context and organize your tasks in jobs. The tracking of important information is accomplished via a GTProjectInformation object, which includes history (GTProjectHistory), usage (GTProjectUsage) and security (GTCredentials).

The jobs are a collection of GTJob's where you can store related jobs with sequences whithin a project. In this sense a project could be a Master Thesis or Original Research Paper and the jobs could be a collection with a GTJob for mutation searching and another GTJob association of polymorphisms, etc.
