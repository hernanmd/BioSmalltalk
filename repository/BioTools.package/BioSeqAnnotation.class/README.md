An annotation is a short description or additional metadata about a biological object like a sequence, gene or collection of genes. A generic annotation supports only authored comments facility. Specialized annotations includes support for additional types of annotations like links, references, etc.

The difference between an Annotation and a Sequence Feature is that a (sequence) Annotation is associated with an entire sequence, while a Sequence Feature is associated with a sequence with a location.
