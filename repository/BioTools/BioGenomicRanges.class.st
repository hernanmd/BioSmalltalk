"
A genomic range represents a Collection of genomic locations (regions or intervals) and associated annotations, enabling to attach chromosome coordinates, sequence name, and a strand.

- Each genomic range is described by 
-- A chromosome name, 
-- A start
-- An end
-- A strand.
- start and end are both considered included into the interval and represents 1-based positions relative to the 5â€™ end of the plus strand of the chromosome, even when the range is on the minus strand.
