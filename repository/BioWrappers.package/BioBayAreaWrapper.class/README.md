BayArea infers the biogeographic histories of taxa sharing a phylogeny, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the joint posterior of biogeographic histories and range evolution parameters given presence-absence (binary) data and a time-calibrated phylogeny. BioBayArea is a wrapper for the open-source software program written in C++.
